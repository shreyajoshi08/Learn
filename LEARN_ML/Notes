Machine Learning Process:
  a. Data Pre-Processing
    -  Import the data
    -  Clean the data
        * Handling Missing Data
        * Handling categorical data 
    -  Split into train and test sets
  b. Modelling
    -  Build Model
    -  Train Model
    -  Make predictions
  c. Evaluation
    - Calculate performance metrics
    -  Make a verdict

- Feature Scaling: 
  * Only applied to columns
  * 2 Types:
    a. Normalization: (X-Xmin) / (Xmax-Xmin); It's range is [0,1]
    b. Standardization: (X-Xavg) / (σ); σ is std. deviation. It's range is [-3, 3]. Only major outliers will fall beyond this range.
